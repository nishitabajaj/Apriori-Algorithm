The Apriori algorithm in data mining is a popular algorithm used for finding frequent itemsets in a dataset.
It is widely used in association rule mining to discover relationships between items in a dataset.
The Apriori algorithm was developed by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994.
It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. 
The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.
